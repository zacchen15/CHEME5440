## Question 2
### Part A
Amplification is required for rapid response to changes in the concentration of attractant or repellent. Adaptation is required for continued sensitivity to changes in the concentration gradient when the receptors become come saturated with attractant/repellent. Both are needed to successfully navigate a concentration gradient because changes need to occur quickly and with high sensitivity.
### Part B
The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CheY is one of the key mechanisms to amplification in this signaling pathway. When CheY is phosphorylated, tumbling frequency increases. When an signal binds, there can be a rapid amplification of the signal almost independent of ligand concentration.
### Part C
What are the mechanisms of adaptation in the proposed models?
The methylation and demethylation of the receptor by CheR and CheB are the primary means of adaptation. The methylation makes the receptor more active which causes more phosphorylation of CheY and more tumbling. This methylation makes the receptor more sensitive to continued changes in the concentration gradient of the attractant when attrantant is already present thus helping to adapt in a new environment where attractant is already present.
### Part D
What is the “robustness” with which Barkai et al. are concerned and why?
Robustness is the idea that the design and function of biological circuits are independent of the biochemical properties that may vary from cell to cell. This idea of robustness is important because it shows that the precision for adaptation is the same and des not vary with protein concentration.
### Part E
They argue that exact adaptation is important because it allows the system to compensate for the presence of continued stimulation, and to be ready for further stimuli.
